## Project Structure

```
.
├── app.py
├── test_app.py
├── Dockerfile
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Flask Application

- The Flask app is located in `app.py`.
- Example run:
  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```

## Testing with Pytest

- Tests are in the `test_app.py` file.
- Run tests:
  ```bash
  pytest test_app.py
  ```

## Continuous Integration (CI/CD Pipeline)

After pushing your code to GitHub, an automatic CI/CD pipeline is triggered using GitHub Actions. The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. **Checkout code** from the repository.
2. **Set up Python** environment.
3. **Install dependencies** from `requirements.txt`.
4. **Run Pytest** to execute all tests.
5. **Build and push Docker image** to DockerHub if tests pass.

### Setting up DockerHub Secrets for CI/CD

To allow GitHub Actions to push your Docker image to DockerHub, you need to set up secrets:

1. **Create a DockerHub Personal Access Token:**
    - Go to your DockerHub account.
    - Navigate to **Account Settings > Security > New Access Token**.
    - Create a token with `read`, `write`, and `delete` permissions.
    - Copy your DockerHub username and the generated token.

2. **Add Secrets to GitHub:**
    - Go to your GitHub repository.
    - Click on **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**.
    - Click **New repository secret**.
    - Add the following secrets:
        - `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your DockerHub username.
        - `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: The personal access token you generated.

These secrets will be accessed securely by the GitHub Actions workflow.

## Dockerization

- Build Docker image locally (optional):
  ```bash
  docker build -t yourusername/flask-app .
  ```
- Run container locally (optional):
  ```bash
  docker run -p 5000:5000 yourusername/flask-app
  ```

## Deployment to DockerHub

Once the CI/CD pipeline completes successfully, the Docker image `flask-app:latest` is automatically pushed to your DockerHub repository (e.g., `yourusername/flask-app:latest`).

## Testing the Docker Image Locally

You can pull and run the image generated by the CI/CD pipeline:

```bash
docker pull yourusername/flask-app:latest
docker run -p 5000:5000 yourusername/flask-app:latest
```

Visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to see your running Flask app.
